# Stock Market Portfolio
• Developed an interactive stock market portfolio project allowing users to buy, sell, and fostering a hands-on
learning experience

• Enabled users to monitor stock performance with dynamic charts and data visualization, providing valuable
insights into market trends and investment decisions

• Additionally, I had integrated OpenCV for face logging, enhancing the project’s security and user authentication by
implementing a facial recognition system during login
